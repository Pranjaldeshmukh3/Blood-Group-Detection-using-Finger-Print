#Blood Group Detection using Fingerprint

This is a Streamlit web application that predicts a personâ€™s **blood group** based on a fingerprint image using a trained deep learning model.

---

##Project Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify fingerprint images into one of the following blood groups:

- A+
- A-
- B+
- B-
- AB+
- AB-
- O+
- O-

The model is deployed in a **Streamlit** web app, allowing users to upload their fingerprint images and view predicted results along with their personal information.

##Features

- Upload fingerprint image (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`)
- Input personal details: Name, Age, Gender, Weight
- Predict blood group using a trained model (`model.h5`)
- View results in a clean, tabular format
- Easy-to-use interface built with **Streamlit**
